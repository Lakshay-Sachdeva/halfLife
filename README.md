# Half Life Calculator
### Calculate the remaining weight of radioactive element left after number of days under variable conditions

---

## Assumptions
 - Half life of element is static in any case, i.e. 1 day.
 - There is no additional factor working on the decay.

---

## How to use
- Enter the initial weight in numbers.
- Enter the daily weight which can be added after decay of each day, enter number (numbers if value changes for each day separated by spaces).
- Enter total number of days for decay
- Click Calcualte, and result will be displayed
